# Lecture 0 - Securing Accounts

## Security

- We might imagine security in the real world as a key to a physical lock.
- In the digital world, there are numerous building blocks to security.
- Authorization is the act of verifying that you are, indeed, the person who should have access to this account.
- Usernames are one way that you attest that you should have access to an account.
- Passwords are another way that you attest that you should have access to an account.
- The idea is that, theoretically, only you should be able to provide both a valid username and password.
- Dictionary attacks are one way that bad actors attempt to guess your password. Indeed, hackers may use a “brute-force attack” by trying lengthy lists of possible passwords to attempt to guess your password. Therefore, it’s very important you defend against attacks by having a very good password.
- When considering security, one should consider the tradeoffs between usability and security. A highly secure service may become less usable. Hence, as you consider your options for maintaining security, think about what makes the most sense for your use case.
