# Lecture 1 - Securing Data

## Passwords

- We focused on our responsibility to keep our data secure.
- However, a third party is always involved in the storing of our data.
- You can imagine how a system may store usernames and passwords within a text file.
- You can also imagine how an adversary may get access to such a text file.
- Could we minimize the risk of storing passwords in plain text?


## Hashing

- Hashing is a method by which we convert some plain text and output it as a hashed value that is less readable.
- Therefore, a hash function creates a hash value. A password is provided to a hash function and then is outputted as a hashed value.
- Without access to the precise hash function, an adversary cannot output the correct password.
- Generally, we want the hash function to output something very cryptic and lacking a pattern. Accordingly, adversaries cannot guess what the algorithm is doing.
- With the username and hash values stored in the server, an adversary cannot easily access the accounts on that server.
- When a user now inputs their password to log in, the password is passed to the hash algorithm again and compares the hash value created with the hash value stored.
- Hence, we have increased the cost, time, and resources required for an adversary to access protected data.
- Still, a dictionary attack could input one value after another from a dictionary into a hash function as a way by which to break it.
- Further, a brute-force attack could attempt to sequentially feed one character after another to attempt to break the password.
- Hypothetically, rainbow tables are another threat, whereby the adversary has a table of all the potential hashed values in a hash table. This, however, would take terabytes, if not petabytes, of storage capacity to accomplish.
- Finally, a problem arises when users utilize the same password and the hashed value of these passwords is exactly the same. How could we solve this problem?


## Salting

- Salting is a process by which an added value is “sprinkled” into the hash function, such that a hash value changes.
- The utilization of a salt value nearly guarantees that the hash values provided by users, even those that have the same passwords, receive a different hashed password.
- Therefore, again, the cost for adversaries to crack these passwords is quite costly.
- NIST recommends that memorized secrets be both hashed and salted.


## One-Way Hash Functions

- One-way hash functions are written in code and take in a string of arbitrary length and output a hash of a fixed length.
- Utilizing such a function, the holder of the hash value and hash function will never know the original password.
- Indeed, in some systems utilizing a one-way hash function, certain passwords may map to the same hash value.


## Codes

- Cryptography is the study of transmitting secure data from one party to another.
- One way we can secure data is through codes.
- Codes convert the words we want to say into a less understandable string of words.
- Encoding involves taking plaintext and converting them into codetext.
- Decoding is the opposite, converting codetext into plaintext.


## Ciphers

- Ciphering involves taking plaintext and enciphering them into ciphertext.
- This process of ciphering is called encryption. The process of deciphering them is called decryption.


## Keys

- Keys are really big strings. These keys are used in encryption and decryption.
- Secret-key cryptography involves the passing of a key and plaintext into an encryption algorithm, where ciphertext is outputted.
- In this scenario, both the sender and receiver have a shared secret with one another in that they both have access to the encryption and decryption algorithm.


## Cryptanalysis

- Cryptanalysis is the field of study and practice where individuals study how to encrypt and decrypt data.
- By evidence of your being part of this course, you, too, may be interested in cryptanalysis.


## Public-Key Cryptography

- You can imagine a scenario where the sender and receiver of secure data may have never personally met. How can one establish a shared secret between two such parties?
- Public-key encryption or asymmetric-key encryption solves this problem.
- First, the sender uses a public key and plaintext and feeds these into an algorithm. This results in ciphertext.
- Second, the receiver uses their secret key, feeding in both this secret key and ciphertext into the algorithm. This results in deciphered text.
- RSA is a standard of encryption that describes this process.


## Key Exchange

- An alternative algorithm is called Diffie-Hellman, the goal of which is key exchange.
- An agreed upon value g and a prime value p are used.
- Party A and Party B have a shared secret value called s.
- Both Party A and Party B have their own private keys.


## Digital Signatures

- Using the building blocks of public keys and private keys, you can use these to sign documents.
- One can sign a document through a two-step process.
- First, a message, the content of a document, is passed to a hash function, resulting in a hash value.
- Second, a private key and a hash are passed to a digital signature algorithm, which results in a digital signature.
- The recipient is able to verify your digital signature by passing the message, the content of the document, to the hash function and receiving a hash. Then, the recipient passes the public key and the signature provided to the decryption algorithm, resulting in a hash value that should match the hash value previously calculated.


## Passkeys

- Passkeys or WebAuthn are a more and more widely available technology.
- Soon, usernames and passwords will become less frequent.
- Passkeys will be device-dependent. For example, when visiting a website on your phone that prompts you to create an account, your phone will generate a public key and a private key.
- Then, you will send your public key to the website.
- From that point forward, to log into the website using that device, or a service that synchronises your passkeys across devices, you will pass a private key paired with a challenge value. An algorithm will produce a signature.


## Encryption in Transit

- Encryption in transit relates to securing data as it moves back and forth through data networks.
- Imagine a scenario where two parties want to communicate with one another.
- We want to prevent a third party from intercepting data in between.
- Third-party services–like email providers–that function as intermediaries may indeed be reading your emails or viewing your messages.
- End-to-end encryption is a way by which users can guarantee that no third party in between can read the data.


## Deletion

- Let’s now consider a fairly mundane scenario, like deleting a file.
- Once files are deleted on a computer, a fingerprint of those deleted files may still be on your computer.
- Operating systems often delete files by simply forgetting where they exist. Hence, the computer may overwrite previous files with new files.
- However, there is no guarantee that the free space on your hard drive is entirely wiped off the fingerprints of old files.
- Secure deletion is a process by which all the remnants of deleted files are changed to zeroes, ones, or a random sequence of zeros and ones.


## Full-Disk Encryption

- Full-disk encryption or encryption at rest entirely encrypts the content of your hard drive.
- If your device is stolen or you sell your device, no one will have access to your encrypted data.
- However, a downside is that if you lose your password or your face changes enough, you will not have access to your data.
- Another downside is that hackers may use this same type of technology through ransomware to encrypt your hard drive and hold it hostage.


## Quantum Computing

- Quantum computing is an emerging computer technology that may be able to provide exponential computing power to adversaries.
- This technology may be used by adversaries to cut down on the time required to guess passwords and break encryption.
- Hopefully, we will have access to such computing power before bad actors do.



# Assignment 1 - 10/10

- **Characterize the difference between a database hack and a database leak.**

    A database hack is when an attack is made intentionally where the hacker exploits vulnerabilities in a database to gain access, whereas a database leak is when information on the database is exposed unintentionally.


- **In what sense might files not actually be deleted even if you empty the recycle bin on Windows or empty the trash on macOS?**

    Even if you empty the recycle bin or the trash can, the files might not be deleted, because what actually happens is that the operating systems marks their space as space available for new data, but the actual data remains on the disk, but the storage forgets it's location, so that the data will be overwritten by new information.


- **How do quantum computers differ from traditional (non-quantum) computers?**

    Instead of using bits like 0 and 1, quantum computers use qubits that can represent 0, 1 or both simultaneously.


- **What is the term for the prevailing method via which public-key (i.e., asymmetric) cryptography enables two parties to establish a shared secret, even over an insecure (i.e., unencrypted) channel?**

    Diffie-Helman key exchange


- **What is a salt, in the context of this lecture?**

    A salt is a random value that is combined with a password before it is processed by an hash function. 


- **Suppose that Alice and Bob need to coordinate a meeting, as by exchanging emails using Microsoft Outlook, a popular client for email. If their emails are encrypted in-transit, who (besides Alice and Bob, or anyone with access to their computer) might nonetheless be able to read the emails, if anyone?**

    The email service providers.


- **Suppose that you have been hired to perform some work for Charlie. After agreeing to terms, you send the contract to Charlie via email, and, later that day, you receive a digitally signed copy from an email address that appears to belong to Charlie but isn't the one to which you sent the contract originally. How can you be as certain as possible, technologically (that is, without consulting Charlie) that Charlie was the one who digitally signed the contract?**

    Using Charlie's public key, I can verify that the digital signature on the contract is valid.


- **MD5 is an example of a still popular hashing algorithm that has been in use since the early 1990s. Note that MD5 is a 128-bit algorithm, meaning its digests (i.e. hash values) are always 128 bits in length, and therefore there are 2^128 unique digests available. Thus, understand that the article's critique that there is a "high potential for collisions," while not invalid or indeed even incorrect, is perhaps something that should be understood with a bit of context. Suppose that a company has made a large file available for download via its website. Why might they also make available the MD5 hash of that file (as is indeed a common practice)?**

    They might do that as a simple integrity check. After downloading the file, the user can compute its MD5 hash locally and compare it with the published hash. If the hash matches, it suggests that the file hasn't been corrupted during transmission.


- **Identify one or more significant differences between a cipher and a hash.**

    Ciphers are reversible whereas hash functions are not.
