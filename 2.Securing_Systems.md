# Lecture 2 - Securing Systems

## Wi-Fi

- Chances are, you have recognized that there are secured and unsecured networks.
- Secured networks utilize encryption to protect data between you and other devices.
- Wi-Fi Protected Access or WPA is a form of encryption utilized to secure networks.


## HTTP

- Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or HTTP, is an unencrypted way by which to transfer data.
- Utilizing HTTP, one is vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle attacks where an adversary could inject additional HTML code into what one is downloading. Advertisements could be injected into all the web pages you are accessing via HTTP. Further, malicious code could be inserted as well.
- Indeed, there are other threats too. Packet sniffing is a way by which an adversary may look inside data that is being transferred between parties. You can imagine how a credit card number placed within an unsecured packet could indeed be detected and stolen by an adversary.
- Cookies are small files that websites put on your computer. Cookies may be used by websites to keep track of who you are, present your emails, or keep track of your shopping cart. Cookies make one vulnerable to session hijacking, whereby an adversary could inject a supercookie to track you.
- How might one defend against such a threat?


## HTTPS

- HTTPS is a secure protocol for HTTP.
- Traffic between parties is encrypted.
- This is accomplished through TLS through public key cryptography.
- A website has a public key that is signed by a third-party called a certificate of type X.509. These websites also have a private key.
- Certificate authorities or CAs are trusted third-party companies that issue certificates.
- When you visit a website, your browser downloads the certificate of that website, runs it through an algorithm, and creates a hash.
- Then, it uses the public key of the website and the signature of that certificate provided to an algorithm to verify that it creates the exact hash found prior.
- If these match, the web browser application is satisfied that this is a secured website.
- HTTPS mathematically does keep us secure, but there are exceptions.
- SSL Stripping is an attack by which an adversary uses HTTP on a website to redirect traffic to a malicious website. An adversary may even redirect one to an HTTPS-secured domain that is not the intended website.
- One way of mitigating this threat is by implementing HSTS or HTTP strict transport security, whereby the server tells the browser to direct all traffic to a secure connection.


## VPN

- A VPN, or virtual private network, establishes an encrypted channel between two points.
- Within a VPN, all traffic is encrypted.
- However, there are some side effects.
- Because the pipeline between two parties results in receiving an IP address from the second party, it will appear to services throughout the web that your IP address is that of the second party: not your original IP address!
- Indeed, people often use a VPN to masquerade as being in another country.


## SSH

- SSH is a secure protocol by which you can execute commands on a remote server.
- If one wants to communicate with a remote computer and execute commands there, one may issue an ssh command. The following is an example of using the SSH command to connect to a server at Stanford University. You would still need appropriate credentials and permissions to successfully connect.
```
ssh stanford.edu
```
- If one has the appropriate access rights, one can execute commands directly on a remote server.


## Ports

- Port numbers are used to direct web traffic toward specific services on a server.
- For example, port 80 directs to HTTP, 443 to HTTPS, and 22 to SSH.
- Servers listen to these ports for incoming traffic.
- Accordingly, adversaries may engage in port scanning where all potential ports are tried to see if they are accepting traffic.
- Penetration testing is an activity that a professional may engage in to check for port-related security vulnerabilities.
- Ethical hacking is the legal business of testing for such vulnerabilities.
- A firewall is a piece of software that protects various services by blocking unauthorized access, including from compromised services on a device.
- Firewalls utilize IP addresses, unique numbers assigned to each computer on a network, to prevent outsiders from participating in traffic.
- Firewalls can also use deep packet inspection, where they examine the data within packets for material that may be of interest to your company. This can be used to check to see if you are emailing the press or other parties that may be considered adversaries by your company.
- Deep packet inspection is used via proxy, where a device in the middle is used as the path by which traffic comes in an out of the network. It is on this proxy that your school or company may change URLs, log what URL you are attempting to browse to, and, hopefully, protect you against potentially harmful behavior.


## Malware

- Malware is malicious software that damages a computer or compromises its security.
- A virus is a piece of software that attaches itself to your computer. Once installed, it can do nearly anything!
- A worm is a malicious piece of software that can move from one computer to another via holes in security.
- A botnet is malicious software that, once installed on your computer, infects other computers and can be used by an adversary to issue commands to thousands of infected computers.
- Computers infected by botnets can be used to issue denial-of-service attacks whereby lots of requests can be issued to a server for the purpose of slowing or shutting it down. Because so many computers are in a botnet, this type of attack can be called distributed denial-of-service attacks from thousands of IP addresses.


## Antivirus

- Antivirus software detects viruses and hopefully can remove them.
- Automatic updates must be enabled to fix security holes in previous iterations of the software.
- Still, one may be vulnerable to zero-day attacks, which exploit unknown vulnerabilities in software before the software company has had a chance to create a fix.



# Assignment 2 - 8/10

- **SETI@Home was a distributed-research computing project that largely ran from 1999â€“2020.Distributed computing is a network-driven tactic to leverage the processing power of many computers at once to, in this case, analyze radio signals captured from deep space in the hopes that those signals might reveal information about the presence of extraterrestrial life in the universe. What type of cybersecurity threat is perhaps most uniquely, given the nature of it, a risk in a research project like SETI@Home, and how might that threat materialize?**

    Malware, specifically the risk of botnets. Since the SETI@Home consists on running software on many computers, a compromised version of that software could be used to spread malicious software that can infect other computers.


- **What are zero-day attacks and why are they a threat?**

    Zero-day attacks, exploit unknown vulnerabilities in software before the software company has had a chance to create a fix. They are a threat, because no one knows about the flaw, so the defenses aren't ready and because it can operate silently and go unnoticed for a long time.


- **What is port scanning and how is it a threat?**

    Port scanning is when all potential ports are tried to see if they are accepting traffic. It's a threat because it helps attackers learn about the system before launching a more targeted attack.


- **What are supercookies? Via what means do we most commonly obtain/receive them, and how do they create threats to our systems?**

    Supercookies are tracking files, that are used by websites and advertisers to track our activity across the web.  We can receive them by visiting websites, through HTTP connections, that are not encrypted. They are a threat because they track us even when we delete regular cookies or use incognito mode, they collect data on our browsing habits, and advertisers can build detailed profiles of our behavior across multiple websites.


- **What makes a worm distinct from a virus?**

    A virus attaches itself to a file or a program, and requires the user to run the infected file or program, and modifies or damages that file or program once activated. Whereas a worm doesn't need a file, it can exist and run on its own, and it can move across networks without user interaction, exploiting security holes.


- **Provide a technological example of "security through obscurity".**

    Changing the default port number of a service.


- **Distinguish the concepts of SSH and VPN.**

    A VPN establishes an encrypted channel between two points, encrypting all traffic and allowing one to appear as if they are in another country by adopting the IP address of the second party, while SSH is a secure protocol used specifically to execute commands on a remote server, requiring appropriate credentials to connect.


- **What purpose does the X.509 standard serve?**

    X.509 is a standard that defines the format of digital certificates, which are used to verify the identity of entities and to enable secure communication over the internet.


- **Why might a company want to perform pen testing?**

    To identify and fix security vulnerabilities in its systems before attackers can exploit them.


- **Of the below HTTP status codes, which most likely suggests that a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack may be occurring?**
