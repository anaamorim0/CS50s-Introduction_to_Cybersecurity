# Lecture 3 - Securing Software

## Phishing

- We introduced an attack called phishing, where an adversary tricks you into providing information of some kind.
- In the source code of a website, for example, in the language of HTML, you may see code like this:
```
<p>...</p>
```
Notice in the code above that a paragraph starts and ends. It begins with an opening tag and a closing tag.
- Similarly, links in web pages use a specific type of tag called an anchor tag to take users from one web page to another.
- Such code looks like this:
```
<a href="https://harvard.edu">Harvard</a>
``` 
Notice that this code is an anchor tag that allows the user to click the word ‘Harvard’ and visit harvard.edu.
- On an actual web page, you could move your mouse over such a link and see where this precise link will take you.
Adversaries may take advantage of your lack of attention to claim you are linking to one web page when you are actually linking to another one.
- For example, an adversary could provide code like this:
```
<a href="https://yale.edu">https://harvard.edu</a>
```
Notice that this code is an anchor tag that tricks the user into clicking https://harvard.edu when it actually browses to yale.edu. While the user will think they are clicking a link for Harvard, they are actually browsing to Yale.
- You can imagine how this strategy can be used by an adversary to trick you into thinking you are visiting one website when you are actually visiting another.
- Adversaries often create fake versions of websites for the sole purpose of tricking users into inputting sensitive information into those websites. For example, if you were a Harvard student visiting such a fake Harvard website, you may attempt to log in and provide your username and password to an adversary.


## Code Injection

- Cross-site scripting, or XSS, is a form of attack where a website is tricked into running malicious code via a user’s input.
- For example, on Google, when you type a search for the term “cat”, notice how the term appears on the screen elsewhere, showing you how many results are present for this search.
- Imagine that an adversary who knows a bit about the web could insert code as input as a way of tricking the website into running such code.
- For example, consider the following code that could be inserted into a search field:
```
<script>alert('attack')</script>
```
- Notice how this script displays a notification that says “attack.” While the Google website will not display such a notice due to security, this is representative of what an adversary could attempt.
- If a website blindly copies user input and outputs what the adversary typed, this is a major security concern.


## Reflected Attack

- A reflected attack is one that takes advantage of how websites accept input to trick a user’s browser into sending a request for information that results in an attack.
- Imagine that a user could be tricked to click a link structured as follows:
```
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27attack%27%29%3C%2Fscript%3E">cats</a>
```
- Notice that this link includes the exact script presented above that is intended to create an attack alert on the user’s screen.
- The user’s actions trick their own web browser into reflecting back an attack upon the user.


## Stored Attack

- A website could be vulnerable to an attack where it is tricked into storing malicious code.
- Imagine where one could email malicious code. If an email provider blindly accepts any code sent to it, any person receiving the malicious code may become a victim of an attack.


## Character Escapes

- Services use character escapes as a way by which to protect against such attacks. Software should escape potentially troublesome characters that represent common coding-based characters.
- For example, code like the following…
```
<p>About 6,420,000,000 <script>alert('attack')</script></p>
```
will be outputted by secured software as…
```
<p>About 6,420,000,000 &lt;script&gt;alert('attack')&lt;/script&gt;</p>
```
- While a bit cryptic, notice that &lt; is used to escape potential characters that would pose a threat to the software. The output of the above then becomes a text-only representation of the malicious code.
- Commonly escaped characters include:
    &lt;, which is is the less-than sign, “<”
    &gt;, which is is the greater-than sign, “>”
    &amp;, which is the ampersand, “&”
    &quot;, which is the double quote, “, itself
    &apos;, which is the single quote, ‘


## HTTP Headers 

- Recall that HTTP headers are additional instructions that are provided to the browser.
- Consider the following header:
```
Content-Security-Policy: script-src https://example.com/
```
- Notice that the above security policy in a website header will only allow Javascript to be loaded via separate files, usually ending in .js. Thus, <script> tags inside HTML will not be run by the browser when this security policy is in place.
- Similarly, the following header will allow CSS only from .css files:
```
Content-Security-Policy: style-src https://example.com/
```
- Notice that style-src indicates that only CSS that is loaded from a .css file will be permitted.


## SQL Injection

- Structured query language or SQL is a programming language that allows for retrieving specific information from a database.
- Consider how an adversary may attempt to trick SQL into executing malicious code.
- Consider the following SQL code:
```
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE username = '{username}'
```
- Notice that here a user’s inputted username is inserted into the SQL code.
- Never trust a user’s input.
- All input should be scrubbed such that all user input is escaped.
- Suppose that an adversary inserted the following code into the username field:
```
malan'; DELETE FROM users; –-
```
- Notice that in addition to a username, malicious code is inserted.
- What results because of the above input is the following:
```
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE username = 'malan'; DELETE FROM users; --'
```
- Notice that the adversary’s malicious input adds additional code to the query. What results is the deletion of all users from the system. Every account on the system is deleted.
- Suppose that a user is asked for a username and password as follows:
```
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE username = '{username}' AND password = '{password}'
```
- Notice a user is asked for a username and password.
- An adversary could insert the following into the password field:
```
' OR '1'='1
```
- The following SQL code will then execute:
```
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE username = 'malan' AND password = ''
OR '1'='1'
```
- Notice grammatically, this results in providing all the users in the database.
- To see this more plainly, notice the additional parentheses added below:
```
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE (username = 'malan' AND password = '')
OR '1'='1'
```
- Notice that this code will either show all users where the username and password combination are true OR all users.
- Effectively, the above input is always true. Through this security vulnerability, the adversary may have information about all users on the system, including the administrator.


## Prepared Statements

- Prepared statements are pre-designed snippets of code that correctly handle many database functions, including user input.
- Such statements, for example, ensure that user-inputted data is properly escaped.
- A prepared statement will take code as the following…
```
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE username = '{username}'
```
and replace it with…
```
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE username = ?
```
- Prepared statements will look for any ' characters and replace them with ''. Hence, our previous attack shown above would be rendered by the prepared statement:
```
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE username = 'malan''; DELETE FROM users; --'
```
- Notice that the ' at the end of ‘malan’ is replaced with '', rendering the malicious code inoperable.
- What results is that malicious characters are escaped, such that malicious code cannot run.


## Command Injection

- A command line interface is a method by which to run a computer system using text-based commands, as opposed to clicking on menus and buttons.
- A command injection attack is one that issues a command on the underlying system itself.
- Should a command be passed from user input to the command line, the effect could be disastrous.
- Two common places of vulnerability are that of system and eval, wherein if you pass user input without sanitization, malicious commands could be issued on a system.
- Always read the documentation to learn how to escape the user’s input.


## Developer Tools

- Let’s return to the world of HTML and the web.
- In the context of the browser, developer tools allow you to poke around some of the underlying code in a web page.
- Consider what we can do using developer tools. Here is the code for a textbox:
```
<input disabled type="checkbox">
```
- Notice that this creates a type of input called a checkbox. Further, notice that this textbox is disabled and not usable via the disabled attribute.
- Perhaps a challenge with the security of HTML is that the HTML is resident on their computer. Therefore, the user could be able to make changes to a local file on their computer.
- A user with access to HTML on their own computer via developer tools can change HTML.
```
<input type="checkbox">
```
- Notice that a local copy of the HTML here has the disabled attribute removed.
- You should never trust client-side validation alone.
- Similarly, consider the following HTML:
```
<input required type="text">
```
- Notice how this text input is required.
- Someone with access to developer tools could remove the requirement of this input as follows:
```
<input type="text">
```
- Notice the required attribute is removed.
- Again, never trust that client-side validation will ensure the security of your web application.


## Server-Side Validation

- Server-side validation provides security features to ensure that user input is appropriate and safe.
- While this topic is beyond the scope of this class, simply trust in the principle that user input should be validated on the server-side. Never trust user input.


## Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

- Another threat is called cross-site request forgery or CSRF.
- Websites use two primary methods to interact with users called GET and POST methods.
- GET gets information from a server.
- You might consider how Amazon uses the GET method for the following HTML:
```
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XLQ2FSK">Buy Now</a>
```
- Notice how with a single click, one can buy this product.
- You can imagine how one may trick someone into buying something they don’t intend.
- One could provide an image that is automatically attempting to buy a product:
```
<img src="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XLQ2FSK">
```
- Notice that no image is provided here. Instead, the browser will attempt to execute the GET method using this web page, making a possibly unauthorized or unwanted purchase.
- Similarly, adversaries can use the POST method to make unauthorized purchases.
- Consider the following HTML of the ‘Buy Now’ button:
```
<form action="https://www.amazon.com/" method="post">
<input name="dp" type="hidden" value="B07XLQ2FSK">
<button type="submit">Buy Now</button>
</form>
```
- Notice how a web form, as implemented above, could naively make one believe that one is safe from an unauthorized purchase. Because this form includes a hidden value that is used by Amazon, hypothetically, for validation, it may make a programmer think that users are safe.
- However, as is the case with many exploits, this feeling of safety is misplaced.
- Indeed, adding only a few lines of code could subvert the above. Imagine an adversary has the following code on their own website (not Amazon’s):
```
<form action="https://www.amazon.com/" method="post">
<input name="dp" type="hidden" value="B07XLQ2FSK">
<button type="submit">Buy Now</button>
</form>
<script>
document.forms[0].submit();
</script>
```
- Notice how a few lines of code on an adversary’s website could locate a form and submit it automatically.
- This ability to trick a user into executing commands on another website is the essence of a CSRF.
- One way to protect against an attack such as this is a CSRF token,where a secret value is generated by the server for each user. Thus, a server will validate that one’s CSRF token presented in their submissions matches the token expected by the server.
- These tokens are often submitted via HTML headers.


## Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE)

- Arbitrary code execution, or ACE, is the act of executing code that is not part of the intended code within software.
- One such threat is called buffer overflow, where software is overwhelmed with input. Such input overflows into other areas of memory, causing the program to malfunction. For example, the software may expect input of a short length, but the user inputs an input of a massive length.
- Another similar threat is called a stack overflow, where overflows can be used to insert and execute malicious code.
- Sometimes, attacks such as these can be used for cracking or bypassing the need to register or pay for a piece of software.
- Further, attacks such as these can be used for reverse engineering to see how code functions.


## Open-Source Software

- One way to circumvent threats like this is to use and make open-source software. Such software’s code is published readily online for anyone to see.
- One can audit the code and make sure that there are fewer security threats.
- These pieces of software are still vulnerable to attacks.


## Closed-Source Software

- Closed-source software is the opposite of open-source software.
- Such software’s code is not available to the public and, therefore, may be less vulnerable to adversaries.
- However, there is a tradeoff between open-source software, where thousands of eyes are looking for vulnerabilities in the software, and closed-source software, where code is hidden from public view.


## App Stores

- App stores are run by entities like Google and Apple, where they monitor submitted code for adversarial intent.
- When you install only authorized software, you are far more protected than installing software from any developer without using an app store.
- App stores employ encryption to accept only software or code that is signed by authorized developers. In turn, app stores sign software with a digital signature. Thus, operating systems can ensure that only authorized, signed software is being installed.


## Package Managers

- Package managers adopt a similar signing mechanism to ensure that what you download from third parties is trustworthy. However, there is no guarantee that one is entirely safe.
- Still, we are always attempting to raise the bar for adversaries to install adversarial code.


## Bug Bounty

- Bug bounties are paid opportunities for individuals to discover and report vulnerabilities in software.
- Bounties such as these may effectively influence would-be adversaries to opt to be paid for finding vulnerabilities rather than deploying them as an attacker.


# Identifying Vulnerabilities

- Developers can examine a database of common vulnerabilities and exposures or CVE numbers to see what adversaries are doing worldwide.
- Further, they may examine the common vulnerabilities scoring system or CVSS to see how severe such threats are.
- There is also an exploit prediction scoring system or EPSS that allows developers to see the potential for vulnerabilities worldwide to allow them to prioritize their security efforts.
- Known exploited vulnerabilities or KEV database is a list of known vulnerabilities.



# Assignment 3 -

- **Distinguish the nature of two types of "cross-site" attacks we discussed: cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgeries (CSRF).**

    XSS involves injecting malicious scripts into trusted websites, causing the user's browser to execute harmful code, often to steal data or manipulate content. In contrast, CSRF tricks an authenticated user into unknowingly submitting requests to a website they're logged into, potentially performing unwanted actions like making a purchase.


- **Why do we need to escape certain characters in inputs?**

    We need to escape certain characters in inputs to prevent malicious code from being executed by websites or applications.
    

- **In the context of SQL, what is a prepared statement?**

    A prepared statement is a predefined SQL query that uses placeholders (?) instead of directly inserting user input into the query.


- **Why is client-side validation considered "less secure", perhaps, than server-side validation?**

    Because it happens in the user's browser, which the user can manipulate. Using browser developer tools, someone can disable or alter validation rules. Since the HTML is stored locally on the user's machine, it cannot be trusted. In contrast, server-side validation happens on the server, which the user cannot control, making it a more reliable way to ensure that the input is secure.


- **Why might it still be a good thing to consider using more open-source software (or, developing it), from a security-minded perspective?**

    Open-source software makes its code publicly available, allowing security researchers, developers, and the community to inspect it for vulnerabilities. This increases the chances of discovering and fixing bugs or security flaws early. In contrast, closed-source software hides its code, making it harder for outsiders to detect issues.


- **How are package managers similar to app stores (such as Apple's App Store, Google Play Store, Microsoft Store, etc.), from a cybersecurity perspective?**

    They are similar in a way that both aim to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the software users install. Both systems use digital signatures to verify that the software comes from a trusted source.


- **What threat does use of Content-Security-Policy fields in our source code help to defend against?**

    It helps to defend against cross-site scripting attacks.


- **Provide a specific example of a situation when you might want to use the HTTP POST method instead of the HTTP GET method.**

    When logging into a website.


- **Why was Heartbleed such a threat to a user's security?**

    Because it allowed attackers to read sensitive data directly from the memory of web servers using vulnerable versions of OpenSSL even without authentication.
