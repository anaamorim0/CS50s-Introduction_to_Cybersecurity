# Lecture 4 - Preserving Privacy

## Web Browsing History

- Your browsing history is both a feature and a potential threat to privacy.
- You may not want someone to have access to what websites you have visited.
- You can clear your browser history. However, you may be logged out of all services.
- Servers typically have logs that track user activities. Therefore, even when you clear your browser history, servers keep track of what you have accessed.
- A server log may appear as follows:
```
log_format combined '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] '
                  '"$request" $status $body_bytes_sent '
                  '"$http_referer" "$http_user_agent"';
```
- Notice that this includes your IP address, your local time, and other details are shared in these digital envelopes being shared between computers.
- How can we exert some sort of control over what we can share?


## HTTP Headers

- As we discussed, HTTP Headers are key-value pairs sent between your computer and a server.
- Consider the following URL that may be visited using the link shown in the following HTML file.
```
<a href="https://example.com">cats</a>
```
- This HTML presents a link called cats that directs the user to example.com.
- When you visit a website, the browser shares by default the link that referred you there.
- When you click a link, the browser shares with websites what website referred you. Hence, the following header is shared from the browser to the server:
```
Referer: https://www.google.com/search?q=cats
```
- Notice that this header shares what you were searching for.
- Would it not be nice to be able to suppress what is being shared? Consider the following:
```
Referer: https://www.google.com/
```
- Notice the following only shares the origin: Not the specific search you were doing.
- The following meta tags can be added to your website to restrict sharing only the origin of traffic.
```
<meta name="referrer" content="origin"> 
```
- Notice the content attribute is set to origin.
- One can restrict further by adding the following to your website to provide no referrer information.
```
<meta name="referrer" content="none">
```
- Notice the content attribute is set to none.


## Fingerprinting

- Each browser presents more or less information about your identity and behavior than others.
- Regardless of the browser you choose, servers log your activities.
- Fingerprinting is a way by which third parties can identify you based upon clues that are available, even when you have restricted your browser from sharing as much information about you as possible.
- One such piece of information is the User-Agent request header, which describes your device as follows:
```
Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; {Android Version}; {Build Tag etc.}) 
AppleWebKit/{WebKit Rev} (KHTML, like Gecko)
Chrome/{Chrome Rev} Mobile Safari/{WebKit Rev}
```
- Notice that your browser, OS version, and device are identified.
- Web servers can also locate your IP address and log it.
- Web servers can also discover your screen resolution, extensions installed, fonts installed, and other information.
- When this information is gathered together over time, it can make you more and more identifiable.


## Session Cookies

- Recall cookies are like a virtual hand stamp to track you individually.
- Session cookies are a piece of information that servers place on your computer to identify you.
- A session cookie may appear as follows:
```
HTTP/3 200
Set-Cookie: session=1234abcd
```
- Notice that this cookie tells the server that your session is 1234abcd.
- Every sequence of session numbers or characters will be unique for each user.
- Session cookies typically expire after a period of time determined by the server.


## Tracking Cookie

- Tracking cookies are designed to track you.
- Third parties use such cookies to track your behavior on a website. Consider the following:
```
Set-Cookie: _ga=GA1.2.0123456789.0; max-age=63072000
```
- Notice that this Google Analytics cookie lasts two years and tracks your activity by presenting itself to each new site you visit.


## Tracking Parameters

- Where cookies are hidden “under the hood” of your browser, tracking parameters are visible in the links you access.
- Consider the following URL:
```
https://example.com/ad_engagement?click_id=YmVhODI1MmZmNGU4&campaign_id=23
```
- Notice that the value for click_id, YmVhODI1MmZmNGU4, tracks you specifically.
- While cookies are tracked in the background, you can see how links you visit (based on the URL) can track you.
- More and more, browsers are tending toward sanitizing tracking parameters. Consider the following URL:
```
https://example.com/ad_engagement?campaign_id=23
```
- Notice that this link only tracks the campaign to which you are responding. There is no longer a value for click_id.


## Third-Party Cookies

- Another type of cookie is a third-party cookie.
- Third parties (i.e., other servers or companies) want to understand how you travel between websites. Consider the following HTTP request:
```
GET /ad.gif HTTP/3
Host: example.com
Referer: https://harvard.edu/
```
- Notice that this request specifically asks to GET a file called ad.gif from example.com.
- Automatically, the server responds with the following headers:
```
HTTP/3 200
Set-Cookie: id=1234abcd; max-age=31536000
```
- The Set-Cookie response header sets a cookie called id that lasts three years.
- If you browse to another website that utilizes the same ad, example.com now knows you are browsing both harvard.edu and yale.edu. Say you later make the following HTTP request:
```
GET /ad.gif HTTP/3
Cookie: id=1234abcd
Host: example.com
Referer: https://yale.edu/
```
- Notice that the third-party cookie from earlier, id=1234abcd, is now being shown to example.com again, thus revealing that you’ve later visited yale.edu.
- Third-party cookies can be used to track us and monetize information about us.


## Private Browsing

- One method by which to help protect your activity is private browsing.
- In a private browsing window or tab, past cookies are eliminated.
- Still, the web still works as the web does! New cookies can still be formed in the ecosystem of a private browsing window.
- Even more poignant, servers can still track your activity within your single browsing session.


## Supercookies

- Whoever provides your internet service can always inject their own cookies into your HTTP headers without your knowledge.
- You may be able to opt out of supercookies with your internet provider.


## DNS

- The Domain name system or DNS is a service by which website names, like harvard.edu, are resolved to specific IP addresses.
- By convention, traffic to DNS is entirely unencrypted. Hence, you are announcing to the world what website you are attempting to visit.
- Your internet service provider and DNS services know exactly where you are attempting to visit.
- An alternative called DNS over HTTPS or DoH, as well as DNS over TLS or DoT, are services by which you can encrypt your DNS requests.


## Virtual Private Network (VPN)

- VPNs, recall, are a way to connect the internet in such a way that it appears you are doing so from a different device.
- VPNs establish an encrypted connection between your own computer (A) and a trusted server (B). Server B then sends your request to the internet, so it appears as if your traffic is coming from B and not A.
- VPNs do not protect you if your computer is infected with malware.
- VPNs will make it appears as though your traffic is coming from the VPN’s IP address instead of your own computer’s.


## Tor

- Tor is a piece of software that redirects your traffic to a node of Tor servers.
- Traffic is directed through many encrypted nodes.
- By design, the software does not remember much of your activity.
- Utilizing such a service provides a high likelihood that little can be identified about you.
- However, do note that if you are the only person utilizing Tor on a local network at your place of work or school, it is quite possible through other means to identify who you are.
- No technology provides you with absolute protection.


## Permissions

- Operating systems are, by growing convention, asking to utilize certain permissions on your device.
- Location-based services, by default, provide your geographic location. Best to be mindful that Apple Maps and Google Maps are very much aware of where you are at any given time if you provide them with such permissions.



# Assignment 4 - 8/10

- **How does the below HTML tag help to protect your privacy online? <meta name="referrer" content="origin">**

    This HTML tag helps to protect your privacy online because by having the "content ="origin" it limits the information given to the website I'm visiting, giving just the origin.


- **What information is transmitted in the User-Agent HTTP header?**

    The browser name and version, the Operating System and version and the device.


- **We discussed in lecture the concept of private browsing, also known as "incognito mode." What is an advantage of private browsing?**

    One advantage is that the past cookies are eliminated.


- **Why might a website use session cookies?**

    A website might use session cookies for example to keep this user logged in while it's navigating across different websites.


- **Tor is software that you can install on your computer that, according to its website, "prevents someone watching your connection from knowing what websites you visit." How, in no more than a paragraph, does Tor do that?**

    Tor redirects your traffic to a node of Tor servers. This traffic is directed through many encrypted nodes.


- **In what sense are domain names similar to phone numbers like 1-800-COLLECT or 1-800-FLOWERS?**

    They are similar in a way that both are easy to remember and stand for some number.


- **Browser Rankings - According to StatCounter, below are the three browsers with top market share as of September 2023. Earlier in 2023, NordVPN, a VPN service, put out a ranking of browsers by the extent to which they take privacy-related measures seriously. Below stats and rankings are accurate as of September 2023.**

- **Google Chrome - User Profiles - NordVPN critiques Chrome (63% market share,  ⭐⭐ privacy rating) on the basis that one of Google's primary sources of revenue is "user profiling for ad targeting". How is Chrome able to put together a user profile for that purpose?**

    Chrome is able to put together a user profile through cookies, tracking parameters, fingerprinting, browsing history.


- **Safari - Fingerprinting - Safari (20% market share, ⭐⭐⭐ privacy rating) receives some praise in the article for its use of "anti-fingerprinting tools". What is fingerprinting?**

    Fingerprinting is a way by which third parties can identify you based upon clues that are available.


- **Edge - Sandboxes - Microsoft's Edge (5% market share, ⭐ privacy rating) comes in at the bottom of the NordVPN list, unfortunately, but receives credit for running in a "sandbox". Why is this a good thing for end-users?**

    It's a good thing for end-users because it provides an additional layer of security by isolating the browser from the rest of the system.


- **Without using the word "refer", what does the $http_referer variable represent, in layman's terms?**

    It represents the webpage the user was in before they clicked on a link to go to the current page.
